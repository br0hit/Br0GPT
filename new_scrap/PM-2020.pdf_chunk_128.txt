EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS AND PRICE REASONABILITY 
8.1 INTRODUCTION: 
GFR 20 17 prescribes that every authority delegated with the financial powers of 
procuring goods in public interest shall have the responsibility and accountability to 
bring efficiency, economy and transparency in matters relating to public procurement 
and for fair and equitable treatment of firms and promotion of competition in public 
procurement. 
8.2 COMMERCIAL EVALUATION OF QUOTE: 
RFP is issued on the basis of the assessed cost as approved by the CFA. The next 
important stage is the commercial evaluation of the bids received in response to the 
RFP that are found technically compliant. These have to be evaluated to work out the 
financial implication of each offer. In order to ensure that all offers are compared in a

implications are to be taken into account. The evaluation criteria adopted for this 
purpose should be indicated in the RFP and the quotations should be ranked as per 
criteria indicated therein. In cases where RFP specifies Life Cycle Cost (LCC) as the 
criteria for the determination of successful bidder, AMC/ product support costs for the 
specified period beyond the original warranty period, will be loaded in CSB and taken 
into consideration for determining L1.

Procuring Entity‟s pocket. The financial bids of the qualified bidde rs would be 
compared on the basis of total cost (FOR destination basis - consignment to Buyer‟s 
premises) of the deliverables and services  including statutory levies, taxes and duties 
on final product which are to be paid extra as per actuals.
