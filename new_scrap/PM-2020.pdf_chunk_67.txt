 Values (NPV) through a more scientific and reliable method. The use of NPV analysis 
is based on the concept of time value of money.  Money has a time value because of 
the opportunity to earn interest or the cost of paying interest on borrowed capital.  This 
means that a sum to be paid today is worth more than a sum to be paid in a future time.  
The cash out-flows/in-flows and the average cost of capital i.e., cost of borrowing 
becomes an important constituent in evaluation process.  The following formula is to be 
used for calculating NPV of a bid: 
𝑁𝑃𝑉 = 𝐴𝑛
(1 +𝑖)𝑡
𝑛 
Where   
NPV = Net Present Value  
An = Expected cost flow for the period mentioned by the subscript  
i = Rate of Interest  or discount factor  
t = Period after which payment is to be made  
n = Payment schedule as per the payment terms and conditions  
When comparing the various bids based on NPV analysis, the bid with the lowest NPV 
should be declared as L1. 
8.9.2 Steps involved in NPV : The application of NPV analysis in defence procurement 
would involve the following five steps: 
a) Step 1: Selection of the discount rate 
b) Step 2: Identifying the cash outflows  
c) Step 3: Establishing the timing of the cash outflow 
d) Step 4: Calculating the NPV of each alternative 
e) Step 5: Selecting the offer with the least NPV 
8.9.3 Example:  In response to a RFP, two bidders have quoted different prices and payment 
terms as per the details given underneath: 
 Quoted 
Price  Payment Plan  
T0 + 1 T0 + 6 T0 + 7 T0 + 9 T0 + 12 
Bidder (1)  102 10% 20% - 30% 40% 
Bidder (2)  100 30% - 40% - 30% 
 
Here T 0 is Contract Effective Date (C ED); Let the rate of interest be 12%. 120 
 Then as per the formula given above, NPV of Bidder (1) is: 
𝑁𝑃𝑉  =(102 ×10/100)
(1 + 12/100)1/12+ (102 ×20/100)
(1 + 12/100 )6/12+   102 ×30/100 
(1 + 12/100)9/12+ (102 ×40/100 )
(1 + 12/100)12/12
=93.92 
and NPV of Bidder (2) is: 
𝑁𝑃𝑉  =(100 ×30/100)
(1 + 12/100)1/12+  (100 ×40/100)
(1 + 12/100 )7/12+   100 ×30/100 
(1 + 12/100)12/12=93.94 
So Bidder (1) is L1. 
8.9.4 Discounting Rate:  Discounting rate to be used under the DCF technique is MCLR 
(Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate) declared by RBI pertaining to SBI for the 
latest month of the year.  
8.9.5 Method for structuring cash flows : A suitable model for structuring cash flows for 
bids is as under:  
a) The first step would be to exclude the unknown variables like escalation factors etc 
while determining the cash flows. 
b) Thereafter the cash out flow as per the price bids of different biddders should be 
taken into consideration and where the cash out flows are not available in the bids, 
the same should be obtained from the respective bidders. Where bids are received 
in different currencies/ combination of currencies, the cash o utflow will be brought 
to a common denomination in rupees by adopting exchange rate (BC selling rate of 
SBI) as on the date of opening of price bids. 
c) Once the outflows of different bids become available, NPV of different bids to be 
calculated using the formula given above and the one with the lowest NPV is to be 
selected. 
8.9.6 When the DCF is to be used : The alternative with the smallest payment of NPV in the 
procurement is the obvious choice.  The DCF may be made use of to facilitate 
determination of L1 in following procurement situations: 
a) To compare different payment terms of the bidders to a common denomination for 
determining L1 status. 
b) To deal with the cases where entering into AMC over a period of more than one 
year is part of the contract for evaluating L1 status. Determination of L1 by merely 
adding the arithmetic values spread over a long period of time would be an 
incorrect procedure for determining L1 and the correct procedure would be to 
reduce cash out flows into present values through the DCF technique, for which the 
discount rate to be adopted should form part of the RFP.
