 Values (NPV) through a more scientific and reliable method. The use of NPV analysis 
is based on the concept of time value of money.  Money has a time value because of 
the opportunity to earn interest or the cost of paying interest on borrowed capital.  This 
means that a sum to be paid today is worth more than a sum to be paid in a future time.  
The cash out-flows/in-flows and the average cost of capital i.e., cost of borrowing 
becomes an important constituent in evaluation process.  The following formula is to be 
used for calculating NPV of a bid: 
𝑁𝑃𝑉 = 𝐴𝑛
(1 +𝑖)𝑡
𝑛 
Where   
NPV = Net Present Value  
An = Expected cost flow for the period mentioned by the subscript  
i = Rate of Interest  or discount factor  
t = Period after which payment is to be made  
n = Payment schedule as per the payment terms and conditions  
When comparing the various bids based on NPV analysis, the bid with the lowest NPV 
should be declared as L1. 
8.9.2 Steps involved in NPV : The application of NPV analysis in defence procurement 
would involve the following five steps: 
a) Step 1: Selection of the discount rate 
b) Step 2: Identifying the cash outflows  
c) Step 3: Establishing the timing of the cash outflow 
d) Step 4: Calculating the NPV of each alternative 
e) Step 5: Selecting the offer with the least NPV 
8.9.3 Example:  In response to a RFP, two bidders have quoted different prices and payment 
terms as per the details given underneath: 
 Quoted 
Price  Payment Plan  
T0 + 1 T0 + 6 T0 + 7 T0 + 9 T0 + 12 
Bidder (1)  102 10% 20% - 30% 40% 
Bidder (2)  100 30% - 40% - 30% 
 
Here T 0 is Contract Effective Date (C ED); Let the rate of interest be 12%.
