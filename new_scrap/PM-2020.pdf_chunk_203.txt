the contractual terms and conditions:  
a) Irrevocable LC  
b) Confirmed LC  
c) Revolving LC  
d) Divisible LC 
1.3.2 Irrevocable LC :  A credit in which the Issuing Bank gives a definite, absolute and 
irrevocable undertaking to honour Buyerâ€™s obligations, provided beneficiary complies with 
all terms and conditions, is known as an irrevocable letter of credit. It implies that LC 
cannot be amended, cancelled or revoked without the consent of all parties. All LCs are 
deemed to be irrevocable.  
1.3.3 Confirmed LC : A confirmed LC is one in respect of which another Bank in the 
beneficiary's country adds its confirmation at the request of the Issuing Bank.  This 
undertaking of the confirming Bank to pay/ negotiate/ accept is in addition to the 
undertaking of the issuing bank. This is an added protection to the beneficiary.   
1.3.4 Revolving LC :  In such LC, the amount of credit is restored, after it has been utilized, to 
the original amount thus obviating the necessity of opening a fresh LC for each dispatch/ 
shipment. Revolving LC is used when the Buyer is to receive partial shipment of goods at 
specific intervals over a long duration.  
1.3.5 Divisible LC : A LC could be divisible or non-divisible. Divisible LC could be opened when 
more than one beneficiary is allowed and payment has to be made as per the 
consignment.
