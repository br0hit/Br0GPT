journals. 
13.4.1 In view of high costs, no library can afford to purchase all the information, materials, 
documents needed or demanded by its readers even if they are relevant to the

the largest number of users and at the least cost" within the resources available. 
Therefore, selection and procurement are important functions of a library for balanced 
resources for current and potential use.
