 8.10 ANALYSIS OF OFFERS FROM FOREIGN BIDDERS :  
Apart from the parameters enumerated earlier in this Chapter regarding analysis, cost 
break up and price indices wherever feasible, efforts should be made to analyze: 
a) The price fixation procedure/ methodology prevailing in the country of the bidder. 
b) The prices of similar products, systems and subsystems wherever available 
should be referred. The database maintained in the respective division connected 
with the procurement of such type of stores should be accessed. 
8.10.1 The foreign bidder may be asked to provide the details of past supplies and contract 
rates, if any, of similar kind of product to other Buyers. 
8.11 TRANSPARENCY IN ASSESSMENT PROCESS :  
Assessment of reasonableness of price is an arduous task, especially where price data 
is not available or in case of overseas purchases.  In such cases, it is important to 
place on record efforts made for arriving at the acceptable price and taking the 
procurement decision.
