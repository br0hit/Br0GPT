 As an example, the following procedure can be followed. In a particular case of 
selection of service provider, It was decided to have minimum qualifying marks for 
technical qualifications as 75 and the weightages of the technical bids and financial bids 
was kept as 70 : 30. In response to the RFP, 3 proposals, A, B & C were received. The 
TCEC awarded them 75, 80 and 90 marks respectively. The minimum qualifying marks 
were 75. All the 3 proposals were, therefore, found technically suitable and their 
financial proposals were opened after notifying the date and time of bid opening to the 
successful participants. The C NC examined the financial proposals and evaluated the 
quoted prices as under: 
Proposal  Evaluated Cost  
A Rs. 120  
B Rs. 100  
C Rs. 110  
Using the formula LEC / EC, where LEC stands for lowest evaluated cost and EC 
stands for evaluated cost, the committee gave them the following points for financial 
proposals:  
Proposal  Evaluated Cost  Cost Marks   
A Rs. 120  (100/120) x 100  = 83 points  
B Rs. 100  (100/100 ) x 100  = 100 points  
C Rs. 110  (100/110 ) x 100  = 91 points  
In the combined evaluation, thereafter, the evaluation committee calculated the 
combined technical and financial score as under: 
 Proposal  Evaluated Cost  Cost Marks  Combined Marks  
A Rs. 120  83 points  (75 x 0.70) + (83 x 0.30) = 77.4 pts  
B Rs. 100  100 points  (80 x 0.70) + (100 x 0.30) = 86 pts  
C Rs. 110  91 points  (90 x 0.70) + (91 x 0.30) = 90.3 pts  
The three proposals in the combined technical and financial evaluation were ranked as 
under:  
Proposal  Evaluated Cost  Cost Marks  Combined Marks  Rank  172 
 A Rs. 120  83 pts  77.4 pts  H3 
B Rs. 100  100 pts  86 pts  H2 
C Rs. 110  91 pts  90.3 pts  H1 
Proposal C at the evaluated cost of Rs.110 was, therefore, declared as winner and 
recommended for negotiations/approval, to the competent authority.
