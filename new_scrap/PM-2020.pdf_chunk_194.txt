PAYMENT/ CLEARANCE OF BILLS 
16.1 GENERAL: 
After the stores have been received in good condition, inspected to the satisfaction of 
the user and Brought on Charge (BOC), it becomes obligatory on the part of Lab/Estt 
to clear the Seller ‟s bills promptly. It is the responsibility of the Lab/Estt to ensure that 
the Seller ‟s bills are paid as per terms and conditions stipulated in the supply order/ 
contract. To prevent any misuse and to promote transparency, all payments to Sellers 
may be made through electronic mode of payment only. The supply orders/ contracts 
may include a clause asking the Sellers to provide details of their banker‟s name, 
branch, branch code, branch address, account (a/c) number, type of a/c, MICR 
number, IFS Code and PAN with their bills as a measure of safety so as to enable the 
paying authority to credit the payment into S ellers‟ a/c directly through electronic mode 
of payment. In situations where electronic mode of payment is not possible, Lab 
Director will authorize the payment by account payee cheque. The Seller will furnish 
bankers details such as banker's name, branch and a/c no. to the paying authority. 
Details of payments made by cheque will be intimated to the local audit authorities 
periodically. 
16.1.1 Lab/Estt will communicate the specimen signatures of the officers authorized, to the 
paying authority, to sign contingent bills, CRVs and other financial documents.  
16.2 DOCUMENTS TO BE ENCLOSED FOR CLAIMING PAYMENT:
