 13 CHAPTER 13  
PROCUREMENT OF TECHNICAL BOOKS AND JOURNALS 
13.1 GENERAL: 
The major objective of DRDO Libraries/ Technical Information (Resource) Centres/ 
Knowledge Centres (KCs) is to provide relevant, required and current information at 
the right time to the scientists working on various projects in the DRDO Labs/Estts.   
These are not academic or general libraries but are special libraries and deal with 
publications in special and focused subject areas. Books, technical reports, standards, 
patents related information, databases, scientific journals and periodicals in print and 
digital form are some of the important types of documents required by DRDO libraries. 
Sometimes, journal articles, audio-visual, optical, multimedia and e-learning material 
as well as ephemeral material may also be required for procurement.  
13.2 DEMAND INITIATION: 
The demand for the technical books and journals would be raised by the Library in-
charge of the Lab/Estt on the basis of requirements projected by the users of technical 
library. Library in-charge may also raise demand for the periodicals and journals to 
complete/ continue the collection in the Library. 
13.3 LIBRARY ADVISORY COMMITTEE (LAC):  
Director of the Lab/Estt may appoint a Library Advisory Committee consisting of 
Chairman of the rank of Scientist 'E' or above, three to five members representing 
various subject disciplines of the Lab/Estt and the Library In-Charge (Officer- In-
Charge) who will also be the Member Secretary. The LAC is an essential body 
advising and guiding the library in its activities and services. The LAC also advises the 
Director of the Lab/Estt on the policy matters pertaining to administration of library. 
13.3.1 Functions of LAC : 
The basic functions of the LAC are as under: 
a) To lay down the general library policy and rules,  
b) To scrutinize the demands for procurement of print and digital documents and 
make necessary recommendations for approval of the CFA for balanced growth 
of library resources, 
c) To lay down and review the procedures for the library to optimize efficiency and
