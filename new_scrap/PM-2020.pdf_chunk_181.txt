OUTSOURCING OF SERVICES 
14.1 GENERAL  
14.1.1 Rule No. 198 of GFR-2017 iterates that a Ministry or Department may outsource certain 
services in the interest of economy and efficiency and it may prescribe detailed

b) Services for which requirements are well known and the skill-set of the service 
provider who can do the job is also well known, and there is no significant 
advantage to have a service provider having higher skill-set. Such services would 
be out-sourced as per the provisions given in earlier chapters.
