 material element and a labour element.  The figures representing the material 
element and the labour element should reflect the corresponding proportion of 
input costs, while the fixed element may range from 10 to 25%. That portion of 
the price represented by the fixed element will not be subject to variation.  The 
portions of the price represented by the material element and labour element will 
attract Price Variation. The formula for Price Variation will thus be: 
𝑃1 = 𝑃0  𝐹+𝑎 𝑀1
𝑀0 + 𝑏 𝐿1
𝐿0 + ………. − 𝑃0  
Where  
P1 : Adjustment amount payable to the Seller (a minus figure will 
indicate a reduction in the Contract Price)  
P0 : Contract Price at the base level  
F : Fixed element not subject to Price Variation   
a : Assigned percentage to the material element in the Contract 
Price  
b : Assigned percentage to the labour element in the Contract Price  
L0 : Wage indices at the base month and year  
L1 : Wage indices at the month and year of calculation  
M0 : Material indices at the base month and year  
M1 : Material indices at the month and year of calculation  
 
If more than one major item of material is involved, the material element can be 
broken up into two or three components such as Mx, My, Mz . Where price 
variation clause has to be provided for services (with insignificant inputs of 
materials) as for example, in getting technical assistance normally paid in the 
form of per diem rate, the price variation formula should have only two elements, 
viz. a high fixed element and a labour element. The fixed element can in such 
cases be 50% or more, depending on the mark-up by the seller of the per diem 
rate vis-à-vis the wage rates.    
b) Following conditions would be applicable to price adjustment: 
(i) Base date shall be last date of bids submission.  
(ii) Date of adjustment shall be midpoint of manufacture.  
(iii) No price increase is allowed beyond original Delivery Period unless the 
delay is attributable to the Buyer or Force Majeure.  
(iv) Total adjustment will be subject to maximum ceiling of ____%.
