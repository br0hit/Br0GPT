 1.9 BANK GUARANTEE (BG): 
1.9.1 Definition :  BG  is  a  written  undertaking  obtained  from  the  Seller through his bank, as 
a guarantee that he would fulfill the promise/ terms and conditions of the contract and to 
ensure the discharge of liability of the Seller in case of his default. Three parties are 
involved in the agreement, namely the Applicant (Seller), the Beneficiary (Buyer) and the 
bank as the guarantor.  
1.9.2 Essential Elements of BG :  The essential elements of BG are as follows:  
a) The prescribed format in which BGs are to be accepted should be enclosed with the

original BG format. The essential elements of BG indicated above should be cross-
checked from the contract for correctness.  
b)  While accepting BGâ€™s of foreign banks it should also be checked that the Applicable 
Law indicated in the Agreement is Indian and the date of validity has been specified. 
c) Sellers be told that BGs to be submitted by them should be sent directly by the 
Issuing Bank to the beneficiary by secured means. 
d) The validity period of BG be checked (60 days beyond completion of all contractual 
obligations, including warranty period if any) 
e) In exceptional cases, when BGs are received through the vendors/ Sellers etc., the 
issuing bank should be requested to immediately send an unstamped duplicate copy 
of the Guarantee directly to the beneficiary with its covering letter to facilitate 
validation.

beneficiary when they are received from the Guarantor Bank. In case of BGs of 
foreign banks, assistance may be sought from SBI to check the authenticity of the 
BGs received. Such authentication would necessarily entail payment of service 
charges to SBI.
