120 
 Then as per the formula given above, NPV of Bidder (1) is: 
𝑁𝑃𝑉  =(102 ×10/100)
(1 + 12/100)1/12+ (102 ×20/100)
(1 + 12/100 )6/12+   102 ×30/100 
(1 + 12/100)9/12+ (102 ×40/100 )
(1 + 12/100)12/12
=93.92 
and NPV of Bidder (2) is: 
𝑁𝑃𝑉  =(100 ×30/100)
(1 + 12/100)1/12+  (100 ×40/100)
(1 + 12/100 )7/12+   100 ×30/100 
(1 + 12/100)12/12=93.94 
So Bidder (1) is L1. 
8.9.4 Discounting Rate:  Discounting rate to be used under the DCF technique is MCLR 
(Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate) declared by RBI pertaining to SBI for the 
latest month of the year.  
8.9.5 Method for structuring cash flows : A suitable model for structuring cash flows for 
bids is as under:  
a) The first step would be to exclude the unknown variables like escalation factors etc 
while determining the cash flows. 
b) Thereafter the cash out flow as per the price bids of different biddders should be 
taken into consideration and where the cash out flows are not available in the bids, 
the same should be obtained from the respective bidders. Where bids are received 
in different currencies/ combination of currencies, the cash o utflow will be brought 
to a common denomination in rupees by adopting exchange rate (BC selling rate of 
SBI) as on the date of opening of price bids. 
c) Once the outflows of different bids become available, NPV of different bids to be 
calculated using the formula given above and the one with the lowest NPV is to be 
selected. 
8.9.6 When the DCF is to be used : The alternative with the smallest payment of NPV in the 
procurement is the obvious choice.  The DCF may be made use of to facilitate 
determination of L1 in following procurement situations: 
a) To compare different payment terms of the bidders to a common denomination for 
determining L1 status. 
b) To deal with the cases where entering into AMC over a period of more than one 
year is part of the contract for evaluating L1 status. Determination of L1 by merely 
adding the arithmetic values spread over a long period of time would be an 
incorrect procedure for determining L1 and the correct procedure would be to 
reduce cash out flows into present values through the DCF technique, for which the 
discount rate to be adopted should form part of the RFP.
