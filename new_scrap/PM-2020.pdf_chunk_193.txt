Defence (R&D) with the concurrence of Addl. FA ( R&D)  & JS. 
15.17 TERMINATION AND REVOCATION OF RC/ PA: 
RC/PA is in the nature of standing offer and a legal contract comes into force only 
when a supply order is placed by the Buyer. Being just a standing offer, embodying 
various terms of the offer, the contract holder may revoke it at any time during its 
currency.  However, reasonable opportunity i.e. not less than thirty days should be 
given to the contractor to represent against any revocation/cancellation of RC/PA.
