a) Items ordered have been delivered successfully. 
b)  The original order was placed on the basis of lowest price negotiated by TPC/NC

c) The repeat order is placed within twelve months from the date of supply and only 
once by the Lab/Estt, the total quantity to be ordered /purchased on repeat order
