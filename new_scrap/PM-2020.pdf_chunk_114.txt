7.3.7 Transfer of Technology (ToT):  ToT is the process of transferring skills, knowledge, 
technologies, methods of manufacturing and facilities by one party to other. This is to 
ensure that the scientific and technological developments are accessible to Labs/Estts 
to further develop and exploit the technology for development of new product, 
processes, applications, materials or services. Following clause may be included in the 
RFP where ToT is being sought:  
“Buyer is desirous of license production of (generic name of store(s)) under ToT. Bu yer 
reserves the right to negotiate ToT terms subsequently but the availability of ToT would 
be a pre-condition for any further procurements. If negotiations for ToT are not held as 
a part of the negotiations for store(s), then subsequent and separate ToT negotiations 
would continue from the stage where the store(s ) has been selected.”  
(In such cases, Labs/Estts. would spell out the requirements and scope of ToT 
depending upon the depth of the technology which is required).

relevant documents within ___ days from the completion of the activity/ supply.” (Lab 
should mention the no. of days and the activity from which the counting will start)

the cost of finance plays a very important role in deciding the cost of an item or service 
being contracted for. RFP should clearly state the terms of payment including stage 
payment/ advance payment, if any, as well as the mode of payment. The payment 
terms should normally be in accordance with the options given in RFP as any change 
of payment terms specified in the RFP can alter L1 determination. In case where the 
payment terms offered by the bidders differ from the options given in the RFP, DCF 
technique may be utilized for LI determination. The standard text of this clause is as 
under: 
a) For Indigenous Seller:  The payment will be made as per the following terms, on 
production of the requisite documents: 
(i) 100% payment within 30 days after receipt, satisfactory installation and
