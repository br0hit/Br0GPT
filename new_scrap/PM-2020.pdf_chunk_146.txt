 of delivery period justifying with sufficient reasons, approval of appropriate authority for 
revision of DP will be obtained before communicating such extension to the Seller. 
Normally, all DP extensions will be accorded with imposition of LD and denial of any 
enhancement in statutory levies that takes place beyond the original DP. However, the 
case may be examined on merit for limiting/ waiving off the LD in terms of para 10.8.2 
of this Manual when due justification exists. While extending the DP, ruling on 
imposition of LD, interest on advances paid and admissibility or otherwise of 
enhancement of statutory levies during the extended period, will invariably be 
mentioned in the DP extension letter. Normally, t he Seller shall formally apply for 
extension of delivery date prior to expiry of date stipulated in the supply order/ contract 
justifying the reasons for not adhering to the specified date of delivery. Action for 
extension of delivery date at the request of the Seller will be considered taking the 
following factors into account: 
a) Urgency of the requirement and whether delay involved has or will cause 
any loss or inconvenience to the Lab/Estt. 
b) It is to be ensured that all applicable BGs are revalidated to cover the 
proposed extension. 
c) Whether difficulties informed by the Seller are justifiable and the Seller has 
made all efforts to carry out their contractual obligation in time. 
d) In case of project requirements, the revised DP falls well within the PDC of 
the project. 
e) No delivery period extension is required to complete inspection if stores are 
delivered within stipulated DP and accepted without any quantity or quality 
claim. 
f) All DP extension should normally be approved before the expiry of 
stipulated delivery schedule, to obviate the need for ex-post-facto sanction. 
g) In case of DP extension due to default of the Seller, the interest-free 
advance paid would become interest-bearing as per para 6.44.2 (e) (iii) and 
7.3.9 (c) of this Manual. 
h) Price increase due to revision of statutory levies, exchange rate variation, 
upward revision of price of Government controlled stores etc. will not be 
admissible during the extended delivery period except when delays are 
attributable to Labs/Estts to fulfill their contractual obligations or in case of 
force majeure or in cases where delay is beyond control of the Seller which
