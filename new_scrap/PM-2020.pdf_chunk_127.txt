based on the merits of the case. Even where IPR is jointly held, Govt. of India will have 
the marching rights on IPR, i.e., the Development Partner will have to give technical 
know-how/design data for production of the item to the designated Production Agency 
nominated by Govt. of India. The Development Partner will, however, be entitled to 
license fee / royalty from designated agency as per agreed terms and conditions. The 
Development Partner will also be entitled to use these intellectual properties for their 
own purposes, which specifically excludes sale or licensing to any third party.”
