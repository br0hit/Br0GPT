nature or enhancing the utility of the existing assets, shall broadly be defined as 
Capital expenditure. Further, in consonance with Rule 99 (a) of the GFR 2017,  all 
charges for the first construction and equipment of a project as well as charges for 
intermediate maintenance of the work while not yet opened for service will be 
treated as Capital expenditure. It shall also bear charges for such further additions

establishment and administrative expenses, shall be classified as Revenue 
expenditure.
